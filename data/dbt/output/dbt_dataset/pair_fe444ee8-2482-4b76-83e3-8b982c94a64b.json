    "answer_body": "<p>With the help of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/435228/suhprano\">@suhprano</a>'s answer, I was able to find the proper solution for my issue. For this reason, I will post an answer to my own question. I do this intending to provide others assistant with similar issues.</p>\n<p>I created the .sqlfluff file in my user profile folder. In this file I have then included the following:</p>\n<pre><code>[sqlfluff]\nexclude_rules = L032\n[sqlfluff:rules]\nmax_line_length = 150\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this case, SQLFluff will load the configuration from any .sql file found at the path specified on this variable.</p>\n"
