    "question_body": "<p>Thank you in advance for helping me in my journey! I am a dbt newb, doing the <a href=\"https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/take/fundamentals/texts/17813360-learning-objectives\" rel=\"noreferrer\">dbt fundamentals course</a>. I am following the directions exactly.</p>\n<p>Sequence of the issue:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>I created .sql files in my models folder and subfolders, compiled them, ran dbt, and they showed up in my Snowflake DW. No problem</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I added a .yml file to one of the sub folders\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QLfPl.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QLfPl.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The issue happens when I click &quot;save&quot; to save the code to the .yml file - that the course provided <a href=\"https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/take/fundamentals/texts/17704336-practice\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.

    "answer_body": "<p>I think it may be this bug: <a href=\"https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3567\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3567</a></p>\n<p>That's related to <a href=\"https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/parsing#partial-parsing\" rel=\"noreferrer\">partial parsing</a>, which is a dbt Core performance optimization used in the dbt Cloud IDE. We rebuilt partial parsing from the ground up in v0.20.0, and we'll be including fixes for bugs we uncover (including that one) in v0.20.1.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you find yourself in an error state like the one above, you can trigger a full re-parse by deleting the file <code>target/partial_parse.msgpack</code>.</p>\n"
