    "answer_body": "<p>You are very close! I'm 96% sure that this is an indentation issue -- the #1 pain point of working with YAML. The solution is that both <code>to</code> and <code>field</code> need to be indented below the <code>relationships</code> key as opposed to at the same level.</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests/#generic-tests\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tests dbt docs page</a> for an example</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-yaml prettyprint-override\"><code>  - name: PROTOCOL_ID\n    tests:\n      - relationships:\n          to: ref('Animal_Protocols')\n          field: id\n</code></pre>\n"
